# üéì Yandex Practicum Projects

This repository contains my completed data analysis and data science projects as part of the [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com/) Data Science program.

Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook with code and conclusions, a dataset (in the `data/` folder), and a dedicated `README.md` describing the project in detail.
